This repo contains my Machine Learning algorithms developed during my "Iniciação Científica". 
Most of the reference material used to develop this algorithms come from the excellent Coursera MOOC "Machine Learning" by Andrew NG.


## Objectives

The primary focus is to implement _Gradient Descent_ for multiple variables using _C language_.





(Iniciação Científica, or, Scientific Iniciation, is something as a junior programme for aspiring researcher, common in Brazil universities).
